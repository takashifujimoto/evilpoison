About
-----

ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with no fat library dependencies,
no fancy graphics, no window decorations, and no flashy wank. It is
largely modelled after GNU Screen which has done wonders in virtual
terminal market.

All interaction with the window manager is done through
keystrokes. ratpoison has a prefix map to minimize the key clobbering
that cripples Emacs and other quality pieces of software.

Building
--------

ratpoison uses autoconf and automake. To build it:

$ ./configure && make

if you want to install it system-wide, simply type 'make install' as
a privileged user:

# make install

If you retrieved ratpoison from the source repository, you will have to
install somewhat recent versions of autoconf and automake before
running:

$ ./autogen.sh

Customization
-------------

Use the configure option '--enable-debug' to enable debugging symbols
and verbose logging.

Use the configure option '--with-xterm=PROG' to set the x terminal
emulator to use. The default is `xterm'.

Consult the INSTALL file for more information about the configure script.
